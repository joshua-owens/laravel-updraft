## Introduction

Laravel Updraft is a fork of the beautifully designed application scaffolding package [Jetstream]() for Laravel. Updraft aims to bring first class support for those who prefer React over the Vue or Livewire.

Jetstream provides the perfect starting point for your next Laravel application and includes login, registration, email verification, two-factor authentication, session management, API support via [Laravel Sanctum](https://github.com/laravel/sanctum), and optional team management.


Jetstream is designed using [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com) and offers your choice of [Livewire](https://jetstream.laravel.com/1.x/stacks/livewire.html) or [Inertia](https://jetstream.laravel.com/1.x/stacks/inertia.html) scaffolding.

## Documentation

Updraft mirrors the Vue set up of the offical Jetstream package. The offical docs on the [Jetstream website](https://jetstream.laravel.com) can be used as a reference as there will be a direct mapping from a `.vue` file to a `.jsx` fie
